PHP2Python
==========

Convert PHP code to Python running under CGI (beta).

Requirements
------------

- PHP 7 with Package PHP-Parser installed (https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser#quick-start)
- Python 3 with Package goto-statement installed (https://pypi.org/project/goto-statement/)


Converting WordPress source code to Python
------------------------------------------

In the folder ./wordpress-5.4 there's a copy of WP and its convertion with the tool:

```
$ python3 php2py.py --keep-ast ./wordpress-5.4
```

This produces \*.py files, the \*.ast (because --keep-ast is used) and if there's any error (which should be at the moment) \*.errors.txt files.

In order to run the converted files you need to specify the full path of the PHP compatibility library in the *PHP2PY_COMPAT* environmental variable:

````
$ cd ./wordpress-5.4
$ PHP2PY_COMPAT=$HOME/php_compat.py python3 index.py
````

There are a few things left to finish in order to get a complete working converting without having to edit to converted code. I was waiting to tackle those before publishing the code but I'm not having much spare time left these days.

Any PR's and/or comments are more than welcome.

Roadmap
-------

- [x] Complete implementation of AST nodes transformation.
- [ ] Address limitations of Python language (single expression lambdas, assigns in statements).
- [ ] Finish implementing all of the supporting PHP functions to run WordPress.
- [ ] Rearrange AST nodes to simplify conversion.
- [ ] Refactor converted code to output Flask/Django code instead. Required an overhaul of the
  import mechanism.
- [ ] Massive cleanup.
